            <h2>Who I Am</h2>
            <p>
                I’m <strong>Krushal Khunt</strong>, a <strong>B.Tech student specializing in Artificial Intelligence and
                    Machine Learning</strong>,
                with a strong inclination toward <strong>web development</strong> and <strong>problem-solving</strong>.

            </p>
            <p>I enjoy working at the intersection of <strong>design and logic</strong>, where clean interfaces meet
                structured thinking. My focus goes beyond just writing code — I care about
                <strong>how systems are built, refined, and improved over time</strong>.

            <h2>How I Think</h2>
            <p>
                I approach learning with a <strong>practical and structured mindset</strong>.
                Instead of relying only on theory, I prefer understanding concepts by
                <strong>applying them in real scenarios</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
                I value <strong>clarity, consistency, and clean structure</strong> in my work.
                Whether I’m building a small feature or a complete project, I focus on
                <strong>readable code</strong> and thoughtful decisions rather than rushing results.
            </p>

                    <p>
                        I began my journey with a <strong>Diploma in Computer Engineering</strong>,
                        where I built a strong foundation in <strong>programming, logic, and system concepts</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Currently, I am pursuing a <strong>B.Tech in Artificial Intelligence and Machine
                            Learning</strong>
                        to deepen my understanding of <strong>data-driven and intelligent systems</strong>.

                    <p>
                        I believe learning is most effective when it is <strong>applied and tested</strong>.
                        I prefer building projects, experimenting with ideas, and
                        <strong>fixing problems independently</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Making mistakes and improving from them has helped me grow both
                        <strong>technically and mentally</strong>.

                    <p>
                        I am driven by the process of <strong>turning ideas into working solutions</strong>.
                        Watching something evolve from concept to execution keeps me motivated.
